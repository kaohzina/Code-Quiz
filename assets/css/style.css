/* THINGS THAT NEED CSS 
/* The header should be nice and colorful
/* The writing should be readable and a decent font to see
/* The boxes that are going to hold the answers should all be uniform and consistnently space apart i.e. flexbox's
/* There should be a style for the highscore box
/* There should be a designated style for the buttons that need to be pressed
/* 
/* 
/* Due to time restraints, don't try to make anything flashy. No hover buttons, no crazy sizing. Just an MVP.
