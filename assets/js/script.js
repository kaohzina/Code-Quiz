//Script will have all the functionality to the quiz itself
//The quiz will have each answer have a certain value: I only need to make 2 values thankfully. One being correct and one being correct
//I need to make buttons that will start the quiz
//I need to make buttons that will clear the highscore list and go back to the main quiz as well.
//

//will hold majority of the code
const startQuiz = function(){

}
//will be used to receive the scores at the end.
const getScore = function(){
